    <h1> Dagdushet History</h1> <hr>
    <p>Dagadusheth Halwai was a successful sweet seller (Halwai) and a rich businessman in the city of <b>Pune</b> in the late <strong>1800s</strong>. His original halwai shop still exists under the name "<i>Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets</i>" near Datta Mandir in Pune.In the late 1800s, he and his wife <em>Laxmibai</em> lost their only son in a plague epidemic. The grieving couple followed the advice of a sage to build a <u>Ganesh temple</u> in Pune in his memory.[5] Later, Dagdusheth adopted, his nephew Govindsheth (born 1865) who was 9 years old at the time of his death. Govindsheth replaced the first Ganesh idol by a new one, with the first one still being present at <mark>Akra Maruti Chowk</mark>. A generous man, he established an additional Ganesh idol in a wrestling gym called Jagoba Dada Talim. This talim was owned by Dagdusheth as he was also a former wrestling trainer. One of the chowk (square) in Pune is named Govind Halwai Chowk, after him. Along with his mother, Govindsheth handled all the programmes like <i>Ganesh Utsav, Datta Jayanti and other festivities</i>. The residence where they resided is now known as <b>Laxmibai Dagdusheth Halwai Sansthan Datta Mandir Trust</b>.</p>
